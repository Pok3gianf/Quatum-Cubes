# 🧪 Quantum Cubes - A Minecraft Mod by Franquito

**Quantum Cubes** is a Minecraft Java mod where chemistry meets chaos. Every mob becomes an element from the periodic table... and they're not here to play nice.

## 🌍 What is Quantum Cubes?

Quantum Cubes is a mod inspired by the progression of *Terraria*, the mysteries of quantum physics, and the explosive creativity of Minecraft. In this mod:

- Every classic mob has a chemical version (e.g., Creeper, Cow, chiken, etc).
- Defeating them drops real elements you can collect and combine.
- Eventually, you'll summon the **Antimatter Dragon**, a cosmic boss that bends reality.

No chemistry degree required... but it might help.
